Objective: Segment mall customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior to enable targeted marketing strategies.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

Source: Kaggle â€“ Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset
Features Used:

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)

ðŸ”¹ Steps Followed:

Data Loading & Exploration â€“ Loaded dataset, checked structure, and visualized feature distributions.

Optional PCA for Visualization â€“ Reduced features to 2D for easy plotting.

K-Means Clustering â€“ Applied with init='k-means++' for faster convergence.

Elbow Method â€“ Determined optimal K by analyzing WCSS.

Cluster Visualization â€“ Color-coded clusters in feature space.

Evaluation â€“ Used Silhouette Score to assess clustering quality.

ðŸ“ˆ Results:

Optimal K: 5

Silhouette Score: ~0.55 (indicates decent separation)

Insight: Customers are clearly grouped by income and spending patterns, enabling better marketing targeting.
